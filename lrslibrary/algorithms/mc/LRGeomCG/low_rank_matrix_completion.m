% function [L,S] = low_rank_matrix_completion(A)

% This example demonstrates how to use the geometry factory for the

% This geometry is described in the paper
% "Low-rank matrix completion by Riemannian optimization"
% Bart Vandereycken - SIAM Journal on Optimization, 2013.
%
% This can be a starting point for many optimization problems of the form:
%
% minimize f(X) such that rank(X) = k, size(X) = [m, n].

% Note that the code is long because it showcases quite a few features of
% Manopt: most of the code is optional.

% Random data generation. First, choose the size of the problem.
% We will complete a matrix of size mxn of rank k:
%m = 200;
%n = 500;
%k = 10;
% Generate a random mxn matrix A of rank k
%L = randn(m, k);
%R = randn(n, k);
%A = L*R';
% Generate a random mask for observed entries: P(i, j) = 1 if the entry
% (i, j) of A is observed, and 0 otherwise.
%fraction = 4 * k*(m+n-k)/(m*n);
%P = sparse(rand(m, n) <= fraction);
% Hence, we know the nonzero entries in PA:
PA = P.*A;

% Pick the manifold of matrices of size mxn of fixed rank k.
problem.M = fixedrankembeddedfactory(m, n, k);

% Define the problem cost function. The input X is a structure with
% fields U, S, V representing a rank k matrix as U*S*V'.
% f(X) = 1/2 * || P.*(X-A) ||^2
problem.cost = @cost;

% Define the Euclidean gradient of the cost function, that is, the
% gradient of f(X) seen as a standard function of X.
% nabla f(X) = P.*(X-A)
problem.egrad = @egrad;

% This is optional, but it's nice if you have it.
% Define the Euclidean Hessian of the cost at X, along H, where H is
% represented as a tangent vector: a structure with fields Up, Vp, M.
% This is the directional derivative of nabla f(X) at X along Xdot:
% nabla^2 f(X)[Xdot] = P.*Xdot
problem.ehess = @euclidean_hessian;

% Check consistency of the gradient and the Hessian. Useful if you
% adapt this example for a new cost function and you would like to make
% sure there is no mistake.

X0.U = U;
X0.S = S;

% Minimize the cost function using Riemannian trust-regions, starting

% Alternatively, we could decide to use a solver such as
% steepestdescent or conjugategradient. These solvers need to solve a
% line-search problem at each iteration. Standard line searches in
% Manopt have generic purpose systems to do this. But for the problem
% at hand, it so happens that we can rather accurately guess how far
% the line-search should look, and it would be a waste to not use that.
% Look up the paper referenced above for the mathematical explanation
% of the code below.
%
% To tell Manopt about this special information, we specify the
% linesearch hint function in the problem structure. Notice that this
% is not the same thing as specifying a linesearch function in the
% options structure.
%
% Both the SD and the CG solvers will detect that we
% specify the hint function below, and they will use an appropriate
% linesearch algorithm by default, as a result. Typically, they will
% try the step t*H first, then if it does not satisfy an Armijo
% criterion, they will decrease t geometrically until satisfaction or
% failure.
%
% Just like the cost, egrad and ehess functions, the linesearch
% function could use a store structure if you like. The present code
% does not use the store structure, which means quite a bit of the
% computations are made redundantly, and as a result a better method
% could appear slower. See the Manopt tutorial about caching when you
% are ready to switch from a proof-of-concept code to an efficient
% code.
%
% The inputs are X (a point on the manifold) and H, a tangent vector at
% X that is assumed to be a descent direction. That is, there exists a
% positive t such that f(Retraction_X(tH)) < f(X). The function below
% is supposed to output a "t" that it is a good "guess" at such a t.
% problem.linesearch = @linesearch_helper;

% Notice that for this solver, the Hessian is not needed.
% [Xcg, xcost, info, options] = conjugategradient(problem, X0);
% 
% fprintf('Take a look at the options that CG used:\n');
% disp(options);
% fprintf('And see how many trials were made at each line search call:\n');
% info_ls = [info.linesearch];
% disp([info_ls.costevals]);
% 
% fprintf('Try it again without the linesearch helper.\n');

% Remove the linesearch helper from the problem structure.
% problem = rmfield(problem, 'linesearch');
% 
% [Xcg, xcost, info, options] = conjugategradient(problem, X0);
% 
% fprintf('Take a look at the options that CG used:\n');
% disp(options);
% fprintf('And see how many trials were made at each line search call:\n');
% info_ls = [info.linesearch];
% disp([info_ls.costevals]);

% If the problem has a small enough dimension, we may (for analysis
% purposes) compute the spectrum of the Hessian at a point X. This may
% help in studying the conditioning of a problem. If you don't provide
% the Hessian, Manopt will approximate the Hessian with finite
% differences of the gradient and try to estimate its "spectrum" (it's
% not a proper linear operator). This can give some intuition, but
% should not be relied upon.
% if problem.M.dim() < 100
