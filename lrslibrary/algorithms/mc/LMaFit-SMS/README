This directory contains the Matlab code lmafit_sms_v1.m 
along with demo files.  To run the demos, simply invoke 
the Matlab script demo_all.m.

This code is for Sparse Matrix Separation (SMS) problem: 
   Given a matrix D = Lr + S where Lr is low-rank
   and S is sparse, find Lr and S.  

The code solves the model:  min ||S||_1 s.t. XY + S = D
which is suitable for problems where the sparse matrix 
S does not dominate the low-rank matrix Lr in magnitude.

For your convenience, the Matlab code inexact_alm_rpca.m
is included which was downloaded from the website:
