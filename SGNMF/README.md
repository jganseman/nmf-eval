# Graph regularized Non-negative matrix factorization with sparsity constraints (SGNMF)


- This MATLAB package implemented a NMF algorithm with graph laplacian regularization and sparsity constraint.
- GNMF implementation is from "Non-negative Matrix Factorization on Manifold".
- Sparsity regularization is added to the original implementation.
