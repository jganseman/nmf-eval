As it is quite complex to start a new git project depending on a ton
of external libraries, here is a small how-to that describes how I
created this repository and configured my local machines.

This is not done with submodules, but with subtrees. For more info,
see https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/05/the-power-of-git-subtree/

1. Created repo nmf-eval on github website.
2. Locally, git clone https://github.com/jganseman/nmf-eval.git

	% ADD Graham Grindlay's NMFlib
	% This was first converted into a separate public repo.
3. git remote add nmflib git://github.com/jganseman/nmflib
4. git fetch nmflib
5. git merge -s ours --no-commit nmflib/master
	% add folder prefix to whatever thing is pulled from this repo:
6. git read-tree --prefix=nmflib/ -u nmflib/master
7. git commit -m "Imported nmflib as subtree"
	% pull the master branch of nmflib in subtree mode
8. git pull -s subtree nmflib master

Afterwards, the following toolboxes were downloaded and added as proper directories in the repository:
- Cichocki et al, NMFLAB for Signal Processing
- Li and Ngom, NMF toolbox for biological data mining
- NMF library from DTU

	% ADD NMF algorithms from LRS library
3. git remote add lrslibrary git://github.com/andrewssobral/lrslibrary
4. git fetch lrslibrary
5. git merge -s ours --no-commit lrslibrary/master
	% add folder prefix to whatever thing is pulled from this repo:
6. git read-tree --prefix=lrslibrary/ -u lrslibrary/master
7. git commit -m "Imported lrslibrary as subtree"
	% pull the master branch of lrslibrary in subtree mode
8. git pull -s subtree lrslibrary master

	% ADD scattering nmf repository

3. git remote add scattnmf git://github.com/joanbruna/scattnmf
4. git fetch scattnmf
5. git merge -s ours --no-commit scattnmf/master
	% add folder prefix to whatever thing is pulled from this repo:
6. git read-tree --prefix=scattnmf/ -u scattnmf/master
7. git commit -m "Imported scattnmf as subtree"
	% pull the master branch of scattnmf in subtree mode
8. git pull -s subtree scattnmf master

	% ADD sparse graph NMF repository	

3. git remote add SGNMF git://github.com/hongyusu/SGNMF
4. git fetch SGNMF
5. git merge -s ours --no-commit SGNMF/master
	% add folder prefix to whatever thing is pulled from this repo:
6. git read-tree --prefix=SGNMF/ -u SGNMF/master
7. git commit -m "Imported SGNMF as subtree"
	% pull the master branch of SGNMF in subtree mode
8. git pull -s subtree SGNMF master
