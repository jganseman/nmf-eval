This is the implementation of the algorithms provided in the several important papers.
To run the algorithms, please run the test_nmf in the command window, and there will be 
some output data. We can find that the Semi-nmf and convex-nmf not only work when input
matrix is nonnegative, but also mixed-sign elements.
